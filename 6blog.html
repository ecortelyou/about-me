        <h2>Rehydration: Post-Run Self-Care</h2>
        <p>When you reach the end of a long run, the temptation to just lay on the floor and sleep the day away is tangible. Believe me, I’ve had my fair share of collapsing onto the ground and staring up at the ceiling, wondering how I possibly managed to run the mileage I just did. However, the recovery stage after your run is just as important (and arguably more important) as your warmup stage before your run. After a long run, <a href="https://www.camelbak.com/blog-post-run-recovery.html" target="_blank">your muscles are low on glycogen,</a> which is responsible for your energy levels. Your hydration levels are low, and your fatigue is through the roof. Having a post-run rehydration routine is incredibly important to ensure that you are properly caring for your body and setting you up for success for your future runs. This blog post will focus on the self-care of rehydration after a run, but it’s worth noting that there are <a href="https://www.nycustompt.com/10-self-care-tips-for-runners/" target="_blank">many other ways to do self-care</a> after a run that doesn’t involve food or drink.</p>
        <h3>Rehydrate Yourself</h3>
        <p>It seems like a no-brainer, but it is important to <a href="https://www.camelbak.com/blog-post-run-recovery.html" target="_blank">begin rehydrating yourself after your run:</a> “Water in the body keeps your joints lubricated, helps regulate blood pressure and temperature, and supports proper muscle function and recovery” (“Post-Run Recovery,” 2023). Because water needs vary for each person, you can <a href="https://www.camelbak.com/hydrated/hydration-calculator" target="_blank">use this hydration calculator</a> to estimate how much water you should be consuming. Or, if you’re like me, just keep drinking until you feel that you’re not about to pass out from dehydration anymore. Just regular water is sufficient for shorter runs, but after a longer run, it may be beneficial to <a href="https://www.si.com/showcase/nutrition/best-electrolyte-drinks" target="_blank">look into sports drinks,</a> which contain large amounts of electrolytes (check out my previous blog post to learn more about <a href="5blog.html" target="_blank">the benefits of electrolytes</a>).</p>
        <h3>Protein Shake Recipe</h3>
        <p>Another thing I mentioned in a previous blog post was <a href="4blog.html" target="_blank">the importance of consuming protein after a run.</a> Although you could take the time to cook up a protein-rich meal after a run, I normally don’t have the energy to do this. An alternative to this is to meal prep some protein shakes. If you follow <a href="https://cheatdaydesign.com/protein-milkshakes/" target="_blank">the recipe below</a> and freeze it in bags, all you need to do is stick it in the blender and enjoy!</p>
        <h3>Vanilla Milkshake Base (For One Milkshake)</h3>
        <li>10oz Skim Milk</li>
        <li>1 Scoop (32g) Vanilla Whey/Casein Blend Protein </li>
        <li>2 tsp Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li>10g Powdered Sugar Substitute (or regular)</li>
        <h3>Additional Ingredients for Blender</h3>
        <li>2oz Additional Skim Milk</li>
        <li>Any Mix-Ins of Your Choice!</li>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>1. In a bowl, whisk together all of the ingredients to make your vanilla protein milkshake base (10oz of milk, scoop of protein powder, vanilla extract, and powdered sugar).<p>
        <p>2. Add the contents to a large freezer bag OR an ice cube tray and freeze overnight. I like to pour it into a large bag and then lay it flat in the freezer, that way you can prep multiple batches and freeze them separately.</p>
        <p>3.	Once completely frozen, break apart the frozen mixture and add to a high-speed blender or food processor with about 2oz of fresh skim milk.</p>
        <p>4.	Blend the milkshake for about 20-30 seconds until it starts to smooth out.</p>
        <p>5.	Scrape down the sides, then add any mix-ins you’d like. Cookies & cream (using Oreo cookies) and Biscoff cookie butter milkshakes are my favorites, but get creative with it!</p>
        <p>6.	Blend on high for 1-2 minutes until the protein milkshake smooths out and fluffs up a bit.</p>
        <p>7.	Pour into a tall cup, add some toppings (whipped cream is highly recommended), and enjoy!</p>

You can add more images if you wish, or subtract, but know that you might also need to move content around to achieve balance. See what happens! Since these images are smaller, you will want to resize your images to less than 600px in width. This will improve load time and thus general accessibility. Don't forget to add alt="text"!-->
